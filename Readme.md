Django Courseworks for Skillfactory Course. see coursework_commands folder for the commands used to satisfy coursework requirements (D2)

For coursework D3 - in order to see individual posts, the pks are 1,2,3 and 8

For coursework D4 - should all work as specified in brief. date format is: the american way - 02/06/2022 - did not figure out how to handle it via html input and post (for now)

For coursework D5 - issue from D4 fixed (thanks Tima!), should all work as specified in brief (couldnt be bothered to create new groups - basic is common, and premium is author)

TODO: try to make it so that users can only edit and delete their own posts and not from other users
